# Attractors
Hydrodynamic Attractors Far From Equilibrium

This repository contains three different numerical schemes to calculate hydrodynamic attractor solutions 
for rBRSSS, kinetic theory and AdS/CFT. Two of these are Mathematica notebooks, while the third one (AdS)
is a Matlab code. Please cite the original paper reference when using these codes.

Also, note the AdS code has originally been written by Bin Wu for this work

https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3715

Please be so kind and also refer to this reference if you use the AdS code.

Thanks!
